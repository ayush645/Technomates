# 1.Background: 
The mining sector is renowned for having a very dangerous and unsafe workplace. Concern for safety in this industry has increased as a result of technological development in extraction processes for expansion of output levels. The majority of events in this dangerous industry, according to safety research conducted thus far, are caused by human mistake, whose prevention would significantly raise workplace safety standards. The cornerstone of India's energy industry is coal. 

According to a study by the National Foundation of India, the coal economy either directly or indirectly affects millions of Indians. It was noted that the coal mining, transportation, electricity, sponge iron, steel, and brick industries employ more than 1.3 crore people in India. 

# 2.Our problem:

Studies show that sudden explosions or blasts in the coal mines are the most fatal disasters inside a coal mine and call for quick remediation. Many times there are events of sudden blasts in the coal mines and the workers are not aware of such sites or may not have the time to safely escape the hazardous area. Evacuation plans are not always optimized to save everyone. In order to prevent such disasters, a software is required which can detect fatal areas or the possible explosion sites in real-time, such that the workforce can be warned beforehand to not to work around that particular area. Even in the case a blast takes place, the area would be already evacuated which would lead to no or minimal fatalities.

Secondly, the software should be build in a way that can be understood by the workers easily because in India, the coal mines are located in areas where people are still not that advanced with latest technological knowledge, especially the workforce. Only if the workers understand how to use this technology of detecting the “hotspots”, the software will be useful.

# 3.Our Solution to the problems we have discovered:

The first problem is of detecting the “hotspots” or the possible explosion areas which can be done using “thermal cameras” which will be placed in multiple areas in the coal mines. Using the thermal images, we can detect the zones where the temperatures are high enough to be able to cause a possible explosion.

Secondly, not everyone will be able to carefully study and understand the thermal images in real-time while working in the mine. So, the thermal images will act as an input to an AR/VR based software that will show the 360-degree view of the coal mine in real time which exactly looks like the mine without any distractions of colours of the heatmap that are there in the thermal images. In this AR/VR based application, the hotspots detected in the thermal images will be mapped to the real-time 360-degree view of the mine along with danger zones depicted in red. The workers are not supposed to enter those areas until they come under the red colour because those are the possible sites of explosions.
The workers just need to look at the 360-degree view of the mine and avoid working in the areas shown in red to prevent fatalities in the coal mines due to unforeseen explosions. Explosions can’t be prevented but fatalities can be.
